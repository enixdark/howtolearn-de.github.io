Nice short book that gives a high level explanation of the most important DDD concepts and patterns. 

https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming The definite (though unfinished) guide to facilitating collaborative modelling in the form of Event Storming sessions from the inventor.

https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping/ Neat introduction to context mapping.

https://leanpub.com/Practicing-DDD If you want to dive deeper into implementing DDD Scott Miletts book is a nice to read and accessible introduction. The first few chapters are also avilable for free on Leanpub.
