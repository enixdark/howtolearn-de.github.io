# Contribute @ howtolearn

At howtolearn, we are open for everyone who wants to share his knowledge with the community.
For a successful contribution, there are only some little steps to follow.

## 1) Write your personal TOP 5 of learning resources for one topic
For our learning paths we need only 5 resources, so there is not too much input at once for a newbie in a topic.

## 2) Add personal reviews for the resources
As a learner, I want to know why you are recommending exactly these articles / blogs / etc. For this reason,
please add a personal review and explain why you think they are the best learning resource for your topic.

## 3) If not already done, describe yourself in a few words below your article

## 4) Create an issue with pull request
Because we have a high quality-demanding, please create an issue where you describe which topic you want
to contribute and create a pull request with your article.
