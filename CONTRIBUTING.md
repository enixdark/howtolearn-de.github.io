# Contribute @ howtolearn

## 1) Create a new article
Fork our repository and create a new file under `src/_posts`. Name it like in the format of the existing files.

## 2) Write your personal TOP 5 of learning resources for your topic
For our learning paths, we need only 5 resources. We don't want to give too much input at once to a newbie on a new topic. Since we are searching for learning paths, you should describe where to start (your number 1), how to proceed (number 2) and so on.

## 3) Add personal reviews for the resources
As learners, we want to know why you are recommending exactly these articles, blogs or other resources. For this reason,
please add a personal review for each resource and explain why you think they are the best to start.

## 4) Describe yourself in a few words below your article
Give us a short introduction about yourself and what makes you the expert on the topic.

## 5) Provide a pull request with your article
When you are finished, please create a pull request with your article.
